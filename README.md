## 🎨 **Framer Motion Animations**  
This project uses `motion.div` from **Framer Motion** to add smooth animations. Example effects include:  
- **Hover effects**: Scaling and shadow transitions.  
- **Fade-in animations**: Cards appear with a slight delay.  
- **Spring-based transitions**: Smooth entry and exit motions.  

Example usage:  
```jsx
<motion.div
  whileHover={{ scale: 1.05, boxShadow: "0px 10px 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.2)" }}
  initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }}
  animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
  transition={{ type: "spring", stiffness: 100 }}
  className="github-card"
>
  {/* Card content here */}
</motion.div>
